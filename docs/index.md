# routeros

`@deckyard/routeros` drives a MikroTik router over the RouterOS binary API.
Each guide covers one topic; the [cheatsheet](cheatsheet.md) lists every
function, constant and struct. MikroTik's
[RouterOS documentation](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/) describes the menus
behind the paths.

This deck is part of [Deckyard](https://github.com/deckyard), community decks for [Jennifer](https://jennifer-lang.dev/).

## Conventions

Snippets assume a connection:

```jennifer
import "@deckyard/routeros/" as mt;

def c as mt.Client init mt.connect("192.168.88.1", "admin", "secret");
# ... snippet ...
mt.disconnect($c);
```

- **Errors.** Input rejected locally throws `Error{kind: "routeros"}` before
  anything is sent. Errors from the router or the connection throw
  `Error{kind: "mikrotik"}`. Both carry a readable `message`.
- **Ids.** RouterOS gives every list item an id like `"*3"`. `add*` functions
  return it, structs carry it in `.id`, and the generic verbs take it. Most
  helpers take a name or a comment instead, because ids change when an item is
  re-created.
- **Verbose mode.** `$c = mt.setVerbose($c, true);` prints every command sent,
  with credentials redacted; `MT_VERBOSE=1` sets it at `connect`. See
  [core.md](core.md).

Every topic has a read-only example in
[`examples/`](https://github.com/deckyard/deck-routeros/tree/main/examples):
`MT_HOST=... MT_USER=... MT_PASSWORD=... jennifer run examples/<topic>.j`.
